# BiTrophy
A multiplatform app for tracking retro (and new!) gaming achievements, completions and other stats like playtime. Supports plugins and theming for extra customisability!

# Welcome!
Hello and welcome to BiTrophy. This is a school project. I'll be straight with you. However, this app is way more than just an old, abandoned school project - this is (or will be) the best way to track completions, trophies/achievements and other stats! I'll walk you through it, step by step.

# Introduction
After that interlude, I now know you want to learn how I made this!

This was a really hard task (or it will be) and I am happy that this is the result. (or I will be pleased by it) This (was/is) a school project started on the 30th April 2025, until January 2026. Here's the rundown, from the top!

BiTrophy (a word mash between "Bit" and "Trophy") is a mobile, web and, soon, desktop app for tracking retro (and new!) game completion. It has extended add-on, theme, skin and multipack support for maximum customisability.

# Features

A beautifully sleek, yet interchangeable user interface with satisfying sounds and graphical effects.

This app is build for everyone. No matter if you're 14 or 41, this app is built for you!

The add-ons available for the app are opt-in, preventing size issues. (A few add-ons are pre-installed, like default theme packs, but these can be disabled and/or deleted with ease)

Official add-ons provide only the best choices for your app, however you can create your own! (Coding knowledge not included)

Theming support allows endless customisability; make your app an NES love letter, or simply go bonkers and mix 'n' match between themes!

Opt-out menus, pop-ups and buttons allow you to reduce clutter.

Ad-free by default. (I'm looking at *you*, xManager...) - however allowing unobtrusive banners supports the project! 

YouTube, VLC & other video players are possible to integrate (but not preinstalled due to size needing to increase) using official add-ons, allowing seamless playback of others' playthroughs!

Image scraper tools will (eventually, as an official add-on) allow you to scrape your own image instead of using defaults.

# Integrations

This app allows you to integrate RetroAchievements, Steam Achievements, Sony and Microsoft platforms. This will allow you to track your achievements, no matter if it's Zelda or The Escapists, Super Mario Bros. or Banjo-Kazooie. This app allows you to track it.

By default, RetroAchievements is the only enabled option. You may install more using add-ons, and if you want, you can even uninstall RetroAchievements. 

This app incorporates its own system too, where you can track completions. There are rewards for completing a game, in part or in full! If you have beaten a game's story, you can mark it as "Story Complete", if you have done everything in a "Freeplay" section of the game (Lego Worlds build mode, and other Freeplay Unlocking mechanics) you can mark it as "Freeplay Complete". If you get all achievements and both completions, you get a special reward! Details soon.

Got your own achievement tracker not yet supported by my official add-ons, the recommended add-ons, or the other community-based add-ons? With a little coding knowledge, you can make your own add-on for it! Just make sure to add a pull request to the Community Add-ons page. Details in the add-ons section below.

# Add-ons

Possibly the most inclusive feature of this app is the extensive add-on support. I chose to use add-ons instead of having everything in-app, as this allows people to curate their own app and experience, tailored to their needs. This is split up into sections.

USER

Hello, user! I see you want to install an add-on! You may go to the add-ons page of the app, or if you want to see the source code of an add-on, simply go to the links at the bottom of this README!

DEVELOPER

So, you want to make your own add-on? Great! Let's get started.

Add-ons are installable either via the app, copy-and-paste into the Add-on folder (for basic scripts) or as APK, ipa, EXE, zip, and other filetypes. (however this is discouraged as it blocks users from installing them cross-platform. If one of these platform-exclusive addons gets popular, you need to program it again in a multiplatform version before I feature it.) There are more instructions in the add-ons pages in the links at the end of this README.

OTHER

Making 3rd party add-ons is in no way discouraged, in fact this is the best way to support this app! However, other add-on based apps (like Kodi) have had 3rd party add-ons that don't follow good practice. This is where this paragraph comes in. I discourage anyone to share their add-ons in any other way from posting them on Github, whether it be my own or another. Getting people to pay for add-ons is not great, and I view it as quite scummy, as you are making people pay for an add-on to an app which is free. So, please don't!

Stealing add-ons is also not good practice. This is obvious as no-one likes their work being stolen. Recreating parts of an official add-on is fine, however these rules are set by developers of the add-ons. Copying too much is frouned upon.
