# BiTrophy
A multiplatform app for tracking retro (and new!) gaming achievements, completions and other stats like playtime. Supports plugins and theming for extra customisability!

# Welcome!
Hello and welcome to BiTrophy. This is a school project. I'll be straight with you. However, this app is way more than just an old, abandoned school project - this is (or will be) the best way to track completions, trophies/achievements and other stats! I'll walk you through it, step by step.
